		<font color="#000" size=2><p><b> In 1976, a small but growing Saurashtra Patel community here in the United States of America, was approached by the Saurashtra Patel Kelvani Mandal in Vallabh Vidyanagar for contributions to help build a much needed (and new) Boarding in Vidyanagar. Small as it was, the Saurashtra Patel community responded to this request admirably. With the help of its generous members, the SPCS raised $5,804 for the worthwhile cause.In 1978, Saurashtra Patel Kelvani Mandal in Ahmedabad called upon the Saurashtra Patel community, which was now a somewhat better organized community for educational aid in India. The now larger community, through its members’ renewed generosity, collected $9,855 to help expand the existing facilities at Ahmedabad.The impact of these concentrated efforts was very encouraging and this awakening as a new group led us to pursue the social, cultural and religious needs of our community here in the United States. The idea to organize our community was conceived by Jayantbhai Zalavadia, Pravinbhai Sheladia and the late Bhimjibhai Bhalala in Washington D.C.This led to the formation of a new group which would pursue the fulfillment of the social, cultural and religious needs of our community here in the U.S and came to be known as the Saurashtra Patel Cultural Samaj (SPCS).In late 1978, a general meeting of our community members was organized at Jayantbhai’s home in Hicksville, NY to present the idea of organizing the Samaj. An ad-hoc committee was formed with Jayantbhai as the President, Popatlal Kabaria as the Vice-President, and the late Zaverbhai Bhayani as Secretary and Madhukant Ramani as Treasurer.</p></font>
